# CompetitiveProgramming
My solutions to competitive programming problems. I have solved these problems for 3 different purposes:
* The course "Advanced Algorithmic Problem Solving" at Linköpings university. The judge is Kattis.
* IMPA (IDA-Mästerskapet i Programmering och Algoritmer). The judge is UVA.
* As a hobby on my spare time. Mostly solved problems on Kattis.

**Note** The goal of competitive programming is to solve the problem as fast as possible. Some of these problems have been solved in sessions where you need to complete as many tasks as possible in a given time period (200 minutes).
